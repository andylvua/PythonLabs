# Laboratory work 9
## Task description

* Develop a hierarchy of classes according to the obtained task from the table 
and describe them in Python algorithmic language.

* Derived classes must be used
> Important: child classes must contain additional attributes that are missing in the parent,
> and differ for two different child classes

Write a snippet of the program using objects of created class types.

| **4**   | **Aircraft**: passenger plane, sports plane, glider, fighter, bomber. |

# Laboratory work 10
This lab is dedicated to the development of data structures such as stacks, lists, binary trees and their implementation using Python.

List of typical operations for managing a given structure:
1. **Linked list** - adding an item to the list, searching for an item by key, outputting item data, removing an item from the list, removing all items from the list, deleting the list;
2. **Binary tree** - entering a node in the tree, finding the node by key, output node data, delete the node, bypass the tree, output all nodes, destroy the tree.

## Task description
**Implement the code according to variant**

> Code should be added to the GitHub as PR

| **3**   | **Circular linked list** | **Device**:<br/> 1. Device type<br/> 2. Model<br/> 3. Manufacture year<br/> 4. Measurment limit |

**Additional methods required:**
* Adding an element in ascending order of the year of manufacture of the device
* Output of all devices with the set limit of measurement

# Laboratory work 11
This laboratory work involves writing code that performs a task from a table in using regular expressions.
